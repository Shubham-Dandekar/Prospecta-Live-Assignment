Suppose you have a CSV file with the data below.
 
A1: 5, A2: 7, A3: 9, B1: 3, B2: 8, B3: =4+5, C1: =5+A1, C2: =A2+B2, C3: =C2+B3
 
This can be represented in an excel sheet below:
 


 

    A 	  B 	  C

1   5     3    =5+A1

2   7     8    =A2+B2

3   9    =4+5  =C2+B3


 
I want a program that will take the CSV input above and produce CSV output with the results.  If it is a value, then return a value.  If it is a formula then calculate the formula and return the value of that formula.
 
1. How will you tackle the challenge above?
Ans:
	I will be read this file using BufferReader and store it to one String.
	Then I will create String array by splitting it whenever a comma (,) occurs.
	I will create a HashMap, then iterate over string array and split (: ) it into two Strings 
	first will become key and second will become value and store it into HashMap.
	Then itereate over map and whenever expression occurs at that time evaluate the expression
	and store the value at that key. If expression contains key then we can call it from HashMap.

2. What type of errors you would you check for?
Ans:
	Check for expression format is proper or not.


3. How might a user break your code?
Ans:
	He can give column key into expressions which may not be exits.
	He can give improper expression format.
	He can give improper style of  csv file.
